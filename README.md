# Scraping/Analyzing NBA Play-By-Play Data in R
Run "PBP scrape.R" to scrape NBA play-by-play data from NBA.com with stints calculated.

"RAPM Analyze.R" has the analysis used to calculate RAPM from [this post](https://www.brianlefevre.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/RAPM_Analyze.html). The RAPM Analyze file is a bit of a mess... The PBP data files for the analysis have not been uploaded on here so you will have to run the PBP scrape file if you wish to have the data.
