# nba-pbp-data
Code for scraping and analyzing NBA play by play data. Run "PBP scrape.R" to scrape the data from NBA.com. 

"RAPM Analyze.R" has the analysis used to calculate RAPM from [this post](https://www.brianlefevre.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/RAPM_Analyze.html). The RAPM Analyze file is a bit of a mess... The PBP data files have not been uploaded on here so you will have to rerun that file if you wish to have the data.
